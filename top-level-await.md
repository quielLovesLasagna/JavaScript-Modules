<h1>Top-Level await</h1>

Top-level await is a modern JavaScript feature that simplifies asynchronous programming in several ways:

<h2>Advantages</h2>

1) **Simplifies Module Loading**: Top-level await eliminates the need to wrap an entire module in an async function when dealing with asynchronous operations.

2) **Improved Readability**: It enhances code readability by reducing the need for .then() chains and making code more straightforward.

3) **Easier Error Handling**: You can handle errors globally by using try-catch blocks at the top level of your module.

4) **Sequential Loading**: It's useful for loading modules or resources sequentially, where one operation depends on the result of the previous one.

#

<h2>Considerations</h2>

1) **Blocking Behavior**: Be aware that top-level await can block the execution of the entire module, potentially causing slower module loading if used extensively.

2) **Compatibility**: Ensure that your runtime environment and tools support top-level await before using it, as not all do.

#

Again, one more important implication of using top-level await -> The fact that if one module imports a module which has a top-level await, then the importing module will wait for the imported module to finish the blocking code.
